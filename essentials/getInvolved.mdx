Agentix is designed to grow and improve with input from a broad range of participants—developers, creators, token holders, and end-users. By getting involved early, you can help shape platform features, refine governance models, and influence which agent services receive priority development.

Ways to participate will include joining the Telegram to discuss ideas, submitting improvement proposals, and engaging in the governance process by staking tokens and voting on changes. As Agentix matures, we’ll introduce more structured avenues for education, mentorship, and co-creation—ensuring that anyone with an interest in on-chain AI agents can contribute, learn, and benefit.
