The MindSphere token will serve as the primary economic resource within the platform. Users spend tokens to access specialized agent features, reward agent creators, and stake tokens to enhance agent credibility or support network security. As the ecosystem grows and agents become more capable, the token captures the value of reliable, on-chain intelligence.

By integrating the token into key platform actions, MindSphere encourages a community-driven model. Participants can vote on changes, propose improvements, or adjust incentives, knowing that their tokens represent both economic and decision-making power. This shared interest aligns everyone toward building a more robust environment for on-chain AI agents.
