### Decentralized AI Agent Creation

**Agentix** is a Web3 platform where anyone can create and manage autonomous AI agents that run on a decentralized network. Instead of relying on a single company or server, these agents follow on-chain rules, interact directly with decentralized services, and earn rewards through the Agentix native token.

### Token-Driven Incentives and Governance

Update your docs to your brand and add valuable content for the best user conversion.

The token is central to Agentix’s economy. Users spend tokens to access specialized agent features, pay agents for completed tasks, and stake tokens to improve agent performance and trust. Token holders can also participate in decision-making about upgrades, policies, and incentives, ensuring that the platform evolves in a direction that benefits its community.

### Expanding Access to On-Chain Intelligence

By lowering barriers to deploying AI agents on a blockchain, Agentix enables a growing ecosystem of services—from analytics to operational tooling—accessible to both technical and non-technical users. As the platform and its agents improve, the token becomes an increasingly important resource for securing, governing, and benefiting from the value created by autonomous, on-chain intelligence.
